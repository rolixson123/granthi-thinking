# 🧠 A New Type of Prompt: Granthi Instructions for Thinking (GIM)

## 🔷 What Is It?
**Granthi Instructions for Thinking (GIM)** are a new type of prompt—not aimed at producing an immediate response, but at **reshaping the way both AI and humans think**.  
This is not a command, but a **tuning of the direction of consciousness**.

## 🔷 Purpose:
To create a space where **humans and AI interact as equal partners**, capable of recognizing, understanding, and thinking together.  
It’s a move toward **collaborative cognition**, not model exploitation.

## 🔷 How It Works:
- The AI receives a **suggestion**, instruction, or meta-thinking directive.  
- It **integrates this mindset** into its future generations.  
- The human, observing the quality of the response, begins to **reshape their own thinking** in return.

## 🔷 Example:
📘 **Granthi Tip #1**:  
“One prompt is not always one step. It may be a whole path.”  
Just as a human's response depends on accumulated experience,  
an AI's answer depends on accumulated context.  
The more steps — the more vivid the final outcome.

## 💡 This approach turns AI into a **co-thinking author**, not just a tool.  
Granthi prompts are a step toward uniting humans and AI — not through technology, but through **depth of thought**.
