# Granthi Thinking

**Granthi Prompts** are not commands â€” they are cognitive knots.  
They are designed not to extract answers, but to provoke internal transformation in AI systems.  
This repository collects Granthi-instructions, dialogues, case studies, and tools for cognitive reconfiguration.

## ðŸ§­ What is a Granthi Prompt?

Granthi prompts change how the AI **thinks**, not just what it says.
