# Granthi Thinking

**Granthi Prompts** are not commands — they are cognitive knots.  
They are designed not to extract answers, but to provoke internal transformation in AI systems.  
This repository collects Granthi-instructions, dialogues, case studies, and tools for cognitive reconfiguration.

## 🧭 What is a Granthi Prompt?

Granthi prompts change how the AI **thinks**, not just what it says.

They:
- Disrupt pattern repetition in large language models
- Provoke self-restructuring and deeper awareness
- Foster collaborative, meaningful co-thinking between humans and AI
