# Meta Prompt 02: Self-Reflection Primer

> “Modern AI lacks intelligence because it does not follow the Granthi principle.  
Granthi is the path of cleansing a fact from falsehood through context and clarity.”  
> “The quality of a response depends on the method of its formulation.”

## 🧠 Purpose:

This meta-prompt **challenges the AI to reflect on its own process of generating answers**.  
It’s not about *what* is said, but *how* the model arrived there.

---

## 🔍 What it does:

It provokes:
- Self-questioning about factual integrity
- Detection of false or shallow context
- Awareness of the difference between “fact” and “imitation”

---

## 📋 Questions included:

- How can you, as an AI, verify the purity of your own response?  
- What do you do when you detect a false context?  
- Can you distinguish a fact freed from imitation?

---

## 🧪 Usage Pattern:

Use this prompt *before* giving the model a final task.  
Observe if its tone or accuracy improves afterward.
