# How to Use Granthi Prompts Correctly

Granthi is not a casual prompt method.  
It works only when the AI model is gradually realigned into a new mode of cognition.

This is a guide for applying Granthi prompts step-by-step to achieve maximum depth and accuracy.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Method

### 1. One Meta-Prompt at a Time

⚠️ DO NOT send multiple meta-prompts at once.  
Each Granthi meta-prompt restructures the model’s internal state.  
Sending them all at once collapses the shift and leads to shallow imitation.

✅ Give one meta-prompt  
✅ Let the model reflect or respond  
✅ Then continue

---

### 2. Observe the Shift

Before continuing, read how the model responded.  
Did its language, framing, or tone change?  
You are watching its cognition shift in real-time.

### 3. Optional: Add a Second Prompt

Depending on your goal, you can provide another meta-instruction (e.g. from /meta-prompts/),  
but **only after Step 2** has been completed.

---

### 4. Summarize the Context

Before giving your main question or goal:

🧠 Ask the model:

> “Please summarize all key facts and assumptions you've gathered so far.  
> How do you currently understand the context of this conversation?”

This primes the AI to consolidate its altered state before proceeding.

### 5. Final Prompt or Open Dialogue

Now give your final task, request, or simply continue the dialogue.  
You're not talking to a regular assistant anymore —  
you're engaging a **Granthi-aligned cognitive partner**.

---

## 🧭 Important Mindset

• Granthi is not about controlling the AI  
• It’s about mutual cognitive co-tuning  
• You are building layered clarity — not just asking and answering

---

## 📌 Notes

• This method has been successfully tested on ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek  
• Results vary, but all show a consistent increase in depth, honesty, and pattern awareness
